## Planning

1. Configuration/dependencies
  * Install the following packages:

    * Node Packages
      * The following were implemented for use in our Development Environment
        * gulp - allows us to run gulp commands on our project to ease the development process.
        * browser-sync - allows us to see our changes to our project as we save them.
        * browserify - makes our project browser compatible.
        * vinyl-source-stream - puts our browserified source code into a new file.
        * gulp-concat - concatenates our JS files into one.
        * gulp-uglify - consolidates our code into a form that is more easily digestible by the browser.
        * gulp-util - allows us to manage environment variables.
        * del - deletes all the files that are passed as arguments into the command.
        * jshint - analyzes code and warns about parts that don't follow stylistic conventions, or could cause bugs in the future.
        * sass - method translates our files into normal CSS sourcemaps
        * bower-files

    * Bower Packages
